# Max's Trof√≠! A Grocery List Creator
  This repository is a unique API that stores multiple grocery lists. It provides
  users rights to register and create a grocery list as they are on the go.
  This API allows the users to perform the CRUD actions to their created grocery
  list. Happy Shopping!
## Planning Story
In order to understand the scope of the project, especially the API portion, I read the proposed schedule and requirements. I decided to start with the backend because this was new territory for me. I started creating a model schema that consisted of name of food, date of purchase, quantity, and category. I also created a user schema that consisted of email, a hashed password, and a token. One of my initial concerns was to be able to complete the work in the allotted time with the amount of model schemas that I had created. I was not too concerned about the user schema because I relied on the previous tic tac toe game project experience.
Next on my list, I had to attach the routers. My routes consisted of grocery routes and user routes. Then, I created grocery curl scripts that consisted of create, read, update and destroy actions. In order to continue my work, I had to stop to understand the way in which CRUD actions work. Lastly, I worked on the server end making sure to create the right connections between files. I also made sure to have the correct middleware in app.use to match the required routes, handler, token and logger to ensure that my server was always listening to its server devport.

## Unsolved Problems/Strived Goals
I would like to add more features to the grocery list creator such as having one
form that does the create, show, edit and delete functions to create a more
interactive user experience. I would like to create a user
schema where users can share a list.
